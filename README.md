## 📚 Academic Context

This project was created as part of a course assignment in the Computer Vision class at Petra Christian University. The goal was to implement a real-time face recognition system using pre-trained models and OpenCV.

---

## 📝 Overview

The system uses a webcam to detect human faces in a live video stream and compares them against a set of known faces to identify individuals. The primary focus is on recognition accuracy and speed, providing a user-friendly interface for demonstration.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face detection via webcam
- Face recognition using deep learning embeddings
- Automated logging of recognized faces
- Simple and intuitive interface
- High accuracy with fast inference time

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `face_recognition`
  - `OpenCV`
  - `NumPy`
  - `os`, `datetime`

---

## Extra Notes

running the code needs a `face` directory with .jpeg formatted image with the name of the identifier as the file name for each face that wants to be identified
eg. bryan.jpeg
